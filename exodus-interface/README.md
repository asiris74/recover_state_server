# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To display the logo of the node provider

You need to place either a `node.png` or `node.svg` file in the `public` directory and then run the build command.

If you decide to use a png file, the recommended height is `52px`.

### `npm install`

Install project dependencies.

### `npm run build:devnet`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run serve:devnet`

Deploy your website with pm2, the default is port 80, you can change it.
